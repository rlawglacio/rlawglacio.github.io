Good question! 

Hei, I'm Rob, Postodoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Bergen (Universitetet i Bergen pÃ¥ norsk[^1]). Previously, I was a PhD candidate at the Scott Polar Research Institue at the University of Cambridge. 

My work uses numerical modelling and observations to disentangle how ice sheets move. In particular, I'm interested in the thermal state and basal motion mechanics of the Greenland Ice Sheet. 

For [my PhD](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.90692) I obtained fibre-optic borehole recordings from a fast-moving outlet glacier, with [results](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abe7136) showing unexcpected variations in temperate layer thickness amongst other fun stuff. I spent the next couple of years modelling this[^2],  which uncovered some [neat behaviour](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq5180) behind these initially inocous discrepancies. 

Now, I use the internal age layering of the Greenland Ice Sheet, as recorded in [radar isochrons](https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JF003215), to better understand how the ice-sheet's dynamics have evolved over the last glacial cycle. This uses Englacial Layer Simulation Architecture (or ELSA) [isochron-tracing method](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-4539-2021) as part of a great group here in Bergen. 

On this site you can find [my publications](https://rlawglacio.github.io/publications) and hopefully a few other bits if I get round to them!
